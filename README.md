1. About ArthSpark
ArthSpark is an end-to-end data engineering project designed to collect, process, and store critical US macroeconomic and energy-related economic data. The pipeline extracts data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API, transforms it for consistency and quality, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database. This robust data foundation serves as the backbone for analyzing the intricate relationship between broad economic trends and energy markets. The project offers flexible data consumption options, including a Streamlit web dashboard and seamless integration with Power BI.

2. Concept & Motivation
The name "ArthSpark" combines "Economic" (from Hindi 'Arth' - अर्थ) with "Spark" (suggesting insight, ignition, and dynamism). This name elegantly ties into the project's core idea: igniting understanding of how economic flows and changes impact the energy landscape.

Understanding energy markets (prices, consumption, production) in isolation is incomplete. They are deeply intertwined with the broader economy. Factors like economic growth, inflation, interest rates, and industrial activity directly impact energy demand and supply. ArthSpark addresses this by building the data infrastructure necessary to provide that crucial macroeconomic context, enabling data-driven insights.

3. Key Features
Automated Data Extraction: Fetches key US macroeconomic and energy data from the FRED API.

Robust Data Transformation: Cleans, standardizes, and prepares raw data using Pandas.

Structured Data Storage: Stores processed data in a PostgreSQL relational database with optimized schema for time series.

Incremental Loading: Efficiently updates the database by fetching only new or revised data since the last pipeline run.

Orchestrated Workflow: Automated end-to-end ETL pipeline for reliable, scheduled data ingestion.

Interactive Visualization:

Streamlit Dashboard: Provides a quick, interactive web interface for data exploration.

Power BI Integration: Seamlessly connects to the PostgreSQL database for advanced business intelligence and reporting.

Modular & Maintainable Code: Designed with clear separation of concerns for easy understanding and future expansion.

4. Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python 3.x

Data Extraction: fredapi library (Python wrapper for FRED API)

Data Manipulation: pandas

Database: PostgreSQL

Database ORM/Connectivity: SQLAlchemy, psycopg2-binary

Environment Management: python-dotenv, venv

Orchestration: Custom Python script (main.py) (Future: Apache Airflow)

Web Dashboard: streamlit, plotly

Business Intelligence: Power BI Desktop

6. Setup & Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the ArthSpark project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+ installed

Git installed

PostgreSQL server installed and running (or Docker Desktop if you prefer containerized PostgreSQL)

Power BI Desktop installed (if you plan to use Power BI for visualization)

Clone the Repository
First, clone this GitHub repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/arthspark_project.git
cd arthspark_project

Virtual Environment Setup
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

python -m venv env

Activate the virtual environment:

On macOS/Linux:

source env/bin/activate

On Windows (Command Prompt):

.\env\Scripts\activate

On Windows (PowerShell):

.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1

Install Dependencies
With your virtual environment activated, install the required Python libraries:

pip install requests pandas psycopg2-binary sqlalchemy python-dotenv streamlit fredapi plotly

Obtain FRED API Key
Go to the FRED API Key Registration page and obtain your free API key.

Create a file named .env in the root of your arthspark_project directory (at the same level as main.py).

Add your FRED API key to this file:

FRED_API_KEY=YOUR_FRED_API_KEY_HERE

Replace YOUR_FRED_API_KEY_HERE with your actual key.

PostgreSQL Database Setup
Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running. Then, create a new database and a dedicated user for ArthSpark.

Connect to your PostgreSQL server using psql or pgAdmin as a superuser (e.g., postgres).

Execute the following SQL commands:

CREATE DATABASE arthspark_db;
CREATE USER arthspark_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_secure_password'; -- Choose a strong, unique password!
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE arthspark_db TO arthspark_user;

Update your .env file with these database credentials:

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=arthspark_db
DB_USER=arthspark_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password # MUST match the password you set above!

(Note: The project was initially debugged with DB_USER=postgres and DB_PASSWORD=adi1234, but using a dedicated user with a strong password is highly recommended for security.)

Database Schema Creation
Execute the create_tables.sql script to set up the necessary tables in your arthspark_db.

Navigate to your arthspark_project directory in the terminal.

Execute the SQL script:

psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U arthspark_user -d arthspark_db -f create_tables.sql

(Enter your arthspark_user password when prompted).

7. How to Run the Pipeline
The main.py script orchestrates the entire ETL process.

Run ETL Pipeline (Initial & Incremental Load)
This command will:

Load series metadata.

Check the database for the last loaded date for each series.

Fetch new or revised data from FRED (or all historical data if no previous load).

Transform the data.

Load/Update the data into your PostgreSQL database.

python main.py

Run this command periodically (e.g., daily) to keep your database updated.

8. Data Visualization
You have two primary options for visualizing the data: a Streamlit web dashboard or Power BI.

Using Streamlit (Optional)
A quick and interactive way to explore your data in a web browser.

Ensure your virtual environment is active.

Run the Streamlit application:

streamlit run streamlit_app.py

This will open the dashboard in your default web browser (usually http://localhost:8501).

Connecting to Power BI
Connect Power BI Desktop directly to your PostgreSQL database.

Ensure your PostgreSQL database is running.

Open Power BI Desktop.

Go to "Home" tab -> "Get Data" -> "PostgreSQL database".

Enter connection details:

Server: localhost

Database: arthspark_db

Enter your database credentials (e.g., arthspark_user and its password).

In the Navigator, select both series_metadata and economic_time_series_data tables.

Click "Load".

Establish Relationship: In the "Model" view, drag series_id from series_metadata to series_id in economic_time_series_data to create a one-to-many relationship.

Build Your Dashboard: Use Power BI's visuals (Cards, Line Charts, Tables) and DAX measures (e.g., Latest Value, % Change from Previous Period) to create your interactive dashboard.

9. Error Handling & Debugging
During development, various errors were encountered and resolved. A detailed log of these errors, their root causes, and solutions is available in the comprehensive project summary document (arthspark_project_summary). Common issues included: environment setup, API key validation, Python import scopes, SQLAlchemy parameter binding, and Streamlit caching.

10. Future Enhancements
Apache Airflow Integration: Replace main.py with a robust Apache Airflow DAG for production-grade scheduling, monitoring, and error handling.

Data Quality Checks: Implement more sophisticated data validation rules within the data_transformer.py module.

Additional Data Sources: Integrate data from other APIs (e.g., EIA for more energy-specific data) or flat files.

Advanced Analytics: Develop more complex analytical models (e.g., time series forecasting, correlation analysis) on top of the prepared data.

Alerting: Set up notifications for pipeline failures or significant data anomalies.

Dockerization: Containerize the entire Python application for easier deployment and portability.
